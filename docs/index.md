## Blindspot Home

Welcome to the Blindspot project home. Blindspot is an accessible Windowless Windows desktop app, focusing on providing access to the Spotify service to blind or partially-sighted screen reader users. 

For screen reader users, this app works by providing feedback to users through their already running screen readers, or optionally Microsoft's SAPI engine. 

However, as of version 2, it may also work by providing a discrete pop-up window in the bottom right corner of your screen, which you can control with keyboard shortcuts without ever losing focus from whatever you were doing before. 

This project is powered by SPOTIFY(R) CORE. 

### What you'll need

To use Blindspot, you need the following:
* A computer running Windows XP or higher
* A Spotify premium account (needed to run all custom Spotify applications)

### Project Status

This app is stable at version 2.1 and is ready for use. Hit the download button to get it now!
